    "A **tensor** is a generalization of scalars (0D), vectors (1D), and matrices (2D) to higher dimensions. It is essentially a multi-dimensional array of numbers, and its number of dimensions is referred to as its **order** or sometimes its **rank** although this latter can be confused with the rank of a matrix which is completely different (c.f SVD). For example:\n",
